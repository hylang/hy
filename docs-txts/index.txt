Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python. Since Hy transforms
its Lisp code into Python abstract syntax tree (AST) objects, you have
the whole beautiful world of Python at your fingertips, in Lisp form.

To install the latest release of Hy, just use the command "pip3
install --user hy". Then you can start an interactive read-eval-print
loop (REPL) with the command "hy", or run a Hy program with "hy
myprogram.hy".
