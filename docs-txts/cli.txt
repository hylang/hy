Command-line interface
**********************

Hy provides a handful of command-line programs for working with Hy
code.

hy
==

"hy" is a command-line interface for Hy that in general imitates the
program "python" provided by CPython. For example, "hy" without
arguments launches the REPL if standard input is a TTY and runs the
standard input as a script otherwise, whereas "hy foo.hy a b" runs the
Hy program "foo.hy" with "a" and "b" as command-line arguments. See
"hy --help" for a complete list of options and *Python's
documentation* for many details. Here are some Hy-specific details:

-m <module>

   Much like Python's "-m", but the input module name will be mangled.

--spy

   Print equivalent Python code before executing each piece of Hy code
   in the REPL:

      => (+ 1 2)
      1 + 2
      ------------------------------
      3

--repl-output-fn

   Set the REPL output function. This can be the name of a Python
   builtin, most likely "repr", or a dotted name like "foo.bar.baz".
   In the latter case, Hy will attempt to import the named object with
   code like "(import foo.bar [baz])".


hy2py
=====

"hy2py" is a program to convert Hy source code into Python source
code. Use "hy2py --help" for usage instructions. It can take its input
from standard input, or from a file or module name provided as a
command-line argument. In the case of a module name, the current
working directory should be the parent directory of that module, and
the output parameter ("--output/-o") is required. When the output
parameter is provided, the output will be written into the given
folder or file. Otherwise, the result is written to standard output.

   Warning:

     "hy2py" can execute arbitrary code (via macros, "eval-when-
     compile", etc.). Don't give it untrusted input.

Hy has no built-in capacity to translate Python to Hy, but see py2hy.


hyc
===

"hyc" is a program to compile files of Hy code into Python bytecode.
Use "hyc --help" for usage instructions. The generated bytecode files
are named and placed according to the usual scheme of your Python
executable, as indicated by "importlib.util.cache_from_source()".

   Warning:

     "hyc" can execute arbitrary code (via macros, "eval-when-
     compile", etc.). Don't give it untrusted input.
