"Python provides various :ref:`binary and unary operators
<py:expressions>`. These are usually invoked in Hy using core macros of
the same name: for example, ``(+ 1 2)`` calls the core macro named
``+``, which uses Python's addition operator. There are a few exceptions
to the names being the same:

- ``==`` in Python is :hy:func:`= <hy.pyops.=>` in Hy.
- ``~`` in Python is :hy:func:`bnot <hy.pyops.bnot>` in Hy.
- ``is not`` in Python is :hy:func:`is-not <hy.pyops.is-not>` in Hy.
- ``not in`` in Python is :hy:func:`not-in <hy.pyops.not-in>` in Hy.

For Python's subscription expressions (like ``x[2]``), Hy has two named
macros, :hy:func:`get <hy.pyops.get>` and :hy:func:`cut <hy.pyops.cut>`.

By importing from the module ``hy.pyops`` (typically with a star import,
as in ``(import hy.pyops *)``), you can also use these operators as
functions. Functions are first-class objects, so you can say things like
``(map - xs)`` to negate all the numbers in the list ``xs``. Since
macros shadow functions, forms like ``(- 1 2)`` will still call the
macro instead of the function.

The functions in ``hy.pyops`` have the same semantics as their macro
equivalents, with one exception: functions can't short-circuit, so the
functions for operators such as ``and`` and ``!=`` unconditionally
evaluate all arguments.

Hy also provides macros for :ref:`Python's augmented assignment
operators <py:augassign>` (but no equivalent functions, because Python
semantics don't allow for this). These macros require at least two
arguments even if the parent operator doesn't; for example, ``(-= x)``
is an error even though ``(- x)`` is legal. On the other hand,
augmented-assignment macros extend to more than two arguments in an
analogous way as the parent operator, following the pattern ``(OP= x a b
c …)`` → ``(OP= x (OP a b c …))``. For example, ``(+= count n1 n2 n3)``
is equivalent to ``(+= count (+ n1 n2 n3)).``"

(defn get [coll key1 #* keys]
  #[[``get`` compiles to one or more :ref:`subscription expressions <subscriptions>`,
  which select an element of a data structure. The first two arguments are the
  collection object and a key; for example, ``(get person name)`` compiles to
  ``person[name]``. Subsequent arguments indicate chained subscripts, so ``(get person
  name "surname" 0)`` becomes ``person[name]["surname"][0]``. You can assign to a
  ``get`` form, as in ::

      (setv real-estate {"price" 1,500,000})
      (setv (get real-estate "price") 0)

  but this doesn't work with the function version of ``get`` from ``hy.pyops``, due to
  Python limitations on lvalues.

  If you're looking for the Hy equivalent of Python list slicing, as in ``foo[1:3]``,
  note that this is just Python's syntactic sugar for ``foo[slice(1, 3)]``, and Hy
  provides its own syntactic sugar for this with a different macro, :hy:func:`cut <hy.pyops.cut>`.

  Note that ``.`` (:ref:`dot <dot>`) forms can also subscript. See also Hyrule's
  :hy:func:`assoc <hyrule.collections.assoc>` to easily assign multiple elements of a
  single collection.]]

  #[[``cut`` compiles to a :ref:`slicing expression <slicings>`, which selects multiple
  elements of a sequential data structure. The first argument is the object to be
  sliced. The remaining arguments are optional, and understood the same way as in a
  Python slicing expression. ::

      (setv x "abcdef")
      (cut x)           ; => "abcdef"
      (cut x 3)         ; => "abc"

      (cut x 0 None 2)  ; => "ace"

  A call to the ``cut`` macro (but not its function version in ``hy.pyops``) is a valid
  target for assignment (with :hy:func:`setv`, ``+=``, etc.) and for deletion (with
  :hy:func:`del`).]]
