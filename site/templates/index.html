<h1>Hi, Welcome to Hy!</h1>

<p>
Hy is a special Lisp langage. It compiles into a Python AST, and allows for
some pretty awesome stuff (like writing Flask or Django apps in Lisp).
</p>
<p>
It's got an extremely simple Macro system, which will hopefully become
a bit more advanced as the language develops.
