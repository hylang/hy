   Hy's mascot, Cuddles the cuttlefish.

This chapter provides a quick introduction to Hy. It assumes a basic background
in programming, but no specific prior knowledge of Python or Lisp.

Lisp-stick on a Python
======================

Let's start with the classic::

    (print "Hy, world!")

This program calls the :func:`print` function, which, like all of Python's
:ref:`built-in functions <py:built-in-funcs>`, is available in Hy.

All of Python's :ref:`binary and unary operators <py:expressions>` are
available, too, although ``==`` is spelled ``=`` in deference to Lisp
tradition. Here's how we'd use the addition operator ``+``::

    (+ 1 3)

This code returns ``4``. It's equivalent to ``1 + 3`` in Python and many other
languages. Languages in the `Lisp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)>`_ family, including
Hy, use a prefix syntax: ``+``, just like ``print`` or ``sqrt``, appears before
all of its arguments. The call is delimited by parentheses, but the opening
parenthesis appears before the operator being called instead of after it, so
instead of ``sqrt(2)``, we write ``(sqrt 2)``. Multiple arguments, such as the
two integers in ``(+ 1 3)``, are separated by whitespace. Many operators,
including ``+``, allow more than two arguments: ``(+ 1 2 3)`` is equivalent to
``1 + 2 + 3``.

Here's a more complex example::

    (- (* (+ 1 3 88) 2) 8)

This code returns ``176``. Why? We can see the infix equivalent with the
command ``echo "(- (* (+ 1 3 88) 2) 8)" | hy2py``, which returns the Python
code corresponding to the given Hy code, or by passing the ``--spy`` option to
Hy when starting the REPL, which shows the Python equivalent of each input line
before the result. The infix equivalent in this case is:

.. code-block:: python

    ((1 + 3 + 88) * 2) - 8

To evaluate this infix expression, you'd of course evaluate the innermost
parenthesized expression first and work your way outwards. The same goes for
Lisp. Here's what we'd get by evaluating the above Hy code one step at a time::

    (- (* (+ 1 3 88) 2) 8)
    (- (* 92 2) 8)
    (- 184 8)
    176

The basic unit of Lisp syntax, which is similar to a C or Python expression, is
the **form**. ``92``, ``*``, and ``(* 92 2)`` are all forms. A Lisp program
consists of a sequence of forms nested within forms. Forms are typically
separated from each other by whitespace, but some forms, such as string
literals (``"Hy, world!"``), can contain whitespace themselves. An
:ref:`expression <expressions>` is a form enclosed in parentheses; its first
child form, called the **head**, determines what the expression does, and
should generally be a function or macro. :py:term:`Functions <function>`, the
most ordinary sort of head, constitute reusable pieces of code that can take in
arguments and return a value. Macros (described in more detail :ref:`below
<tutorial-macros>`) are a special kind of function that's executed at
compile-time and returns code to be executed at run-time.

Comments start with a ``;`` character and continue till the end of the line. A
comment is functionally equivalent to whitespace. ::

    (setv password "susan")   ; My daughter's name

Although ``#`` isn't a comment character in Hy, a Hy program can begin with a
:ref:`shebang line <shebang>`, which Hy itself will ignore::

   #!/usr/bin/env hy
   (print "Make me executable, and run me!")

Literals
========

Hy has :ref:`literal syntax <syntax>` for all of the same data types that
Python does. Here's an example of Hy code for each type and the Python
equivalent.

==============  ================  =================
Hy              Python            Type
==============  ================  =================
``1``           ``1``             :class:`int`
``1.2``         ``1.2``           :class:`float`
``4j``          ``4j``            :class:`complex`
``True``        ``True``          :class:`bool`
``None``        ``None``          ``NoneType``
``"hy"``        ``'hy'``          :class:`str`
``b"hy"``       ``b'hy'``         :class:`bytes`
``#(1 2 3)``    ``(1, 2, 3)``     :class:`tuple`
``[1 2 3]``     ``[1, 2, 3]``     :class:`list`
``#{1 2 3}``    ``{1, 2, 3}``     :class:`set`
``{1 2  3 4}``  ``{1: 2, 3: 4}``  :class:`dict`
==============  ================  =================

The Hy REPL prints output in Hy syntax by default, with the function :hy:func:`hy.repr`::

  => [1 2 3]
  [1 2 3]

But if you start Hy like this::

  $ hy --repl-output-fn=repr

the REPL will use Python's native ``repr`` function instead, so you'll see values in Python syntax::

  => [1 2 3]
  [1, 2, 3]


Basic operations
================

Set variables with :hy:func:`setv`::

    (setv zone-plane 8)

Access the elements of a list, dictionary, or other data structure with
:hy:func:`get <hy.pyops.get>`::

    (setv fruit ["apple" "banana" "cantaloupe"])
    (print (get fruit 0))  ; => apple
    (setv (get fruit 1) "durian")
    (print (get fruit 1))  ; => durian

Access a range of elements in an ordered structure with :hy:func:`cut`::

    (print (cut "abcdef" 1 4))  ; => bcd

Conditional logic can be built with :hy:func:`if`::

    (if (= 1 1)
      (print "Math works. The universe is safe.")
      (print "Math has failed. The universe is doomed."))

As in this example, ``if`` is called like ``(if CONDITION THEN ELSE)``. It
executes and returns the form ``THEN`` if ``CONDITION`` is true (according to
:class:`bool`) and ``ELSE`` otherwise.

What if you want to use more than form in place of the ``THEN`` or ``ELSE``
clauses, or in place of ``CONDITION``, for that matter? Use the macro
:hy:func:`do` (known more traditionally in Lisp as ``progn``), which combines
several forms into one, returning the last::

   (if (do (print "Let's check.") (= 1 1))
     (do
       (print "Math works.")
       (print "The universe is safe."))
     (do
       (print "Math has failed.")
       (print "The universe is doomed.")))

For branching on more than one case, try :hy:func:`cond <hy.core.macros.cond>`::

    (setv somevar 33)
    (cond
      (> somevar 50)
        (print "That variable is too big!")
      (< somevar 10)
        (print "That variable is too small!")
      True
        (print "That variable is jussssst right!"))

The macro ``(when CONDITION THEN-1 THEN-2 …)`` is shorthand for ``(if CONDITION
(do THEN-1 THEN-2 …) None)``.

Hy's basic loops are :hy:func:`while` and :hy:func:`for`::

    (setv x 3)
    (while (> x 0)
      (print x)
      (setv x (- x 1)))  ; => 3 2 1

    (for [x [1 2 3]]
      (print x))         ; => 1 2 3

A more functional way to iterate is provided by the comprehension forms such as
:hy:func:`lfor`. Whereas ``for`` always returns ``None``, ``lfor`` returns a list
with one element per iteration. ::

    (print (lfor  x [1 2 3]  (* x 2)))  ; => [2, 4, 6]


Functions, classes, and modules
===============================

Define named functions with :hy:func:`defn`::

    (defn fib [n]
      (if (< n 2)
        n
        (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
    (print (fib 8))  ; => 21

Define anonymous functions with :hy:func:`fn`::

    (print (list (filter (fn [x] (% x 2)) (range 10))))
      ; => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Special symbols in the parameter list of ``defn`` or ``fn`` allow you to
indicate optional arguments, provide default values, and collect unlisted
arguments::

    (defn test [a b [c None] [d "x"] #* e]
      [a b c d e])
    (print (test 1 2))            ; => [1, 2, None, 'x', ()]
    (print (test 1 2 3 4 5 6 7))  ; => [1, 2, 3, 4, (5, 6, 7)]

Set a function parameter by name with a ``:keyword``::

    (test 1 2 :d "y")             ; => [1, 2, None, 'y', ()]

Note that unlike Python, Hy doesn't always evaluate function arguments (or
the items in a literal list, or the items in a literal dictionary, etc.) in
the order they appear in the code. But you can always force a particular
evaluation order with :hy:func:`do`, or with other macros that provide an
implicit :hy:func:`do`, like :hy:func:`when` or :hy:func:`fn`.

Define classes with :hy:func:`defclass`::

    (defclass FooBar []
      (defn __init__ [self x]
        (setv self.x x))
      (defn get-x [self]
        self.x))

Here we create a new instance ``fb`` of ``FooBar`` and access its attributes by
various means::

    (setv fb (FooBar 15))
    (print fb.x)         ; => 15
    (print (. fb x))     ; => 15
    (print (.get-x fb))  ; => 15
    (print (fb.get-x))   ; => 15

Note that syntax like ``fb.x`` and ``fb.get-x`` only works when the object
being invoked (``fb``, in this case) is a simple variable name. To get an
attribute or call a method of an arbitrary form ``FORM``, you must use the
syntax ``(. FORM x)`` or ``(.get-x FORM)``.

Access an external module, whether written in Python or Hy, with
:hy:func:`import`::

    (import math)
    (print (math.sqrt 2))  ; => 1.4142135623730951

Python can import a Hy module like any other module so long as Hy itself has
been imported first, which, of course, must have already happened if you're
running a Hy program.

.. _tutorial-macros:

Macros
======

Macros are the basic metaprogramming tool of Lisp. A macro is a function that
is called at compile time (i.e., when a Hy program is being translated to
Python :mod:`ast` objects) and returns code, which becomes part of the final
program. Here's a simple example::

    (print "Executing")
    (defmacro m []
      (print "Now for a slow computation")
      (setv x (% (** 10 10 7) 3))
      (print "Done computing")
      x)
    (print "Value:" (m))
    (print "Done executing")

If you run this program twice in a row, you'll see this:

.. code-block:: text

    $ hy example.hy
    Now for a slow computation
    Done computing
    Executing
    Value: 1
    Done executing
    $ hy example.hy
    Executing
    Value: 1
    Done executing

The slow computation is performed while compiling the program on its first
invocation. Only after the whole program is compiled does normal execution
begin from the top, printing "Executing". When the program is called a second
time, it is run from the previously compiled bytecode, which is equivalent to
simply::

    (print "Executing")
    (print "Value:" 1)
    (print "Done executing")

Our macro ``m`` has an especially simple return value, an integer (:py:class:`int`), which at
compile-time is converted to an integer model (:class:`hy.models.Integer`). In general, macros can return
arbitrary Hy forms to be executed as code. There are several helper macros that
make it easy to construct forms programmatically, such as :hy:func:`quote`
(``'``), :hy:func:`quasiquote` (`````), :hy:func:`unquote` (``~``),
:hy:func:`unquote-splice` (``~@``), and :hy:func:`defmacro!
<hyrule.macrotools.defmacro!>`. The previous chapter has :ref:`a simple example
<do-while>` of using ````` and ``~@`` to define a new control construct
``do-while``.

What if you want to use a macro that's defined in a different module?
``import`` won't help, because it merely translates to a Python ``import``
statement that's executed at run-time, and macros are expanded at compile-time,
that is, during the translation from Hy to Python. Instead, use :hy:func:`require <require>`,
which imports the module and makes macros available at compile-time.
``require`` uses the same syntax as ``import``. ::

   => (require tutorial.macros)
   => (tutorial.macros.rev (1 2 3 +))
   6

Hy also supports reader macros, which are similar to ordinary macros, but
operate on raw source text rather than pre-parsed Hy forms. They can choose how
much of the source code to consume after the point they are called, and return
any code. Thus, reader macros can add entirely new syntax to Hy. For example,
you could add a literal notation for Python's :class:`decimal.Decimal` class
like so::

    => (import  decimal [Decimal]  fractions [Fraction])
    => (defreader d
    ...   (.slurp-space &reader)
    ...   `(Decimal ~(.read-ident &reader)))
    => (print (repr #d .1))
    Decimal('0.1')
    => (print (Fraction #d .1))
    1/10
    => ;; Contrast with the normal floating-point .1:
    => (print (Fraction .1))
    3602879701896397/36028797018963968

``require`` can pull in a reader macro defined in a different module with
syntax like ``(require mymodule :readers [d])``.

Hyrule
======

`Hyrule <https://pypi.org/project/hyrule>`_ is Hy's standard utility library.
It provides a variety of functions and macros that are useful for writing Hy
programs. ::

    => (import hyrule [inc])
    => (list (map inc [1 2 3]))
    [2 3 4]
    => (require hyrule [assoc])
    => (setv d {})
    => (assoc d  "a" 1  "b" 2)
    => d
    {"a" 1  "b" 2}

Next steps
==========

You now know enough to be dangerous with Hy. You may now smile villainously and
sneak off to your Hydeaway to do unspeakable things.

Refer to Python's documentation for the details of Python semantics. In
particular, :ref:`the Python tutorial <tutorial-index>` can be helpful even if
you have no interest in writing your own Python code, because it will introduce
you to the semantics, and you'll need a reading knowledge of Python syntax to
understand example code for Python libraries.

Refer to the rest of this manual for Hy-specific features. Like Hy itself, the
manual is incomplete, but :ref:`contributions <hacking>` are always welcome.

Bear in mind that Hy is still unstable, and with each release along the
way to Hy 1.0, there are new breaking changes. Refer to `the NEWS file
<https://github.com/hylang/hy/blob/master/NEWS.rst>`_ for how to update your
code when you upgrade Hy, and be sure you're reading the version of this manual
(shown at the top of each page) that matches the version of Hy you're running.
