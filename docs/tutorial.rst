This chapter provides a quick introduction to Hy. It assumes a basic background
in programming, but no specific prior knowledge of Python or Lisp.

Lisp-stick on a Python
======================

Let's start with the classic::

    (print "Hy, world!")

This program calls the :func:`print` function, which, like all of Python's
:ref:`built-in functions <py:built-in-funcs>`, is available in Hy.

All of Python's :ref:`binary and unary operators <py:expressions>` are
available, too, although ``==`` is spelled ``=`` in deference to Lisp
tradition. Here's how we'd use the addition operator ``+``::

    (+ 1 3)

This code returns ``4``. It's equivalent to ``1 + 3`` in Python and many other
languages. Languages in the `Lisp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)>`_ family, including
Hy, use a prefix syntax: ``+``, just like ``print`` or ``sqrt``, appears before
all of its arguments. The call is delimited by parentheses, but the opening
parenthesis appears before the operator being called instead of after it, so
instead of ``sqrt(2)``, we write ``(sqrt 2)``. Multiple arguments, such as the
two integers in ``(+ 1 3)``, are separated by whitespace. Many operators,
including ``+``, allow more than two arguments: ``(+ 1 2 3)`` is equivalent to
``1 + 2 + 3``.

Here's a more complex example::

    (- (* (+ 1 3 88) 2) 8)

This code returns ``176``. Why? We can see the infix equivalent with the
command ``echo "(- (* (+ 1 3 88) 2) 8)" | hy2py``, which returns the Python
code corresponding to the given Hy code, or by passing the ``--spy`` option to
Hy when starting the REPL, which shows the Python equivalent of each input line
before the result. The infix equivalent in this case is:

.. code-block:: python

    ((1 + 3 + 88) * 2) - 8

To evaluate this infix expression, you'd of course evaluate the innermost
parenthesized expression first and work your way outwards. The same goes for
Lisp. Here's what we'd get by evaluating the above Hy code one step at a time::

    (- (* (+ 1 3 88) 2) 8)
    (- (* 92 2) 8)
    (- 184 8)
    176

The basic unit of Lisp syntax, which is similar to a C or Python expression, is
the **form**. ``92``, ``*``, and ``(* 92 2)`` are all forms. A Lisp program
consists of a sequence of forms nested within forms. Forms are typically
separated from each other by whitespace, but some forms, such as string
literals (``"Hy, world!"``), can contain whitespace themselves. An
**expression** is a form enclosed in parentheses; its first child form, called
the **head**, determines what the expression does, and should generally be a
function, macro, or special operator. Functions are the most ordinary sort of
head, whereas macros (described in more detail below) are functions executed at
compile-time instead and return code to be executed at run-time. Special
operators are one of :ref:`a fixed set of names <special-forms>` that are
hard-coded into the compiler, and used to implement everything else.

Comments start with a ``;`` character and continue till the end of the line. A
comment is functionally equivalent to whitespace. ::

    (print (** 2 64))   ; Max 64-bit unsigned integer value

Although ``#`` isn't a comment character in Hy, a Hy program can begin with a
`shebang line <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_, which Hy itself
will ignore::

   #!/usr/bin/env hy
   (print "Make me executable, and run me!")

Literals
========

Hy has :ref:`literal syntax <syntax>` for all of the same data types that
Python does. Here's an example of Hy code for each type and the Python
equivalent.

==============  ================  =================
Hy              Python            Type
==============  ================  =================
``1``           ``1``             :class:`int`
``1.2``         ``1.2``           :class:`float`
``4j``          ``4j``            :class:`complex`
``True``        ``True``          :class:`bool`
``None``        ``None``          :class:`NoneType`
``"hy"``        ``'hy'``          :class:`str`
``b"hy"``       ``b'hy'``         :class:`bytes`
``(, 1 2 3)``   ``(1, 2, 3)``     :class:`tuple`
``[1 2 3]``     ``[1, 2, 3]``     :class:`list`
``#{1 2 3}``    ``{1, 2, 3}``     :class:`set`
``{1 2  3 4}``  ``{1: 2, 3: 4}``  :class:`dict`
==============  ================  =================

In addition, Hy has a Clojure-style literal syntax for
:class:`fractions.Fraction`: ``1/3`` is equivalent to ``fractions.Fraction(1,
3)``.

The Hy REPL prints output in Python syntax by default::

  => [1 2 3]
  [1, 2, 3]

But if you start Hy like this (a shell alias might be helpful)::

  $ hy --repl-output-fn=hy.contrib.hy-repr.hy-repr

the interactive mode will use :ref:`hy-repr-fn` instead of Python's native
``repr`` function to print out values, so you'll see values in Hy syntax::

  => [1 2 3]
  [1 2 3]


Basic operations
================

Set variables with :ref:`setv`::

    (setv zone-plane 8)

Access the elements of a list, dictionary, or other data structure with
:ref:`get`::

    (setv fruit ["apple" "banana" "cantaloupe"])
    (print (get fruit 0))  ; => apple
    (setv (get fruit 1) "durian")
    (print (get fruit 1))  ; => durian

Access a range of elements in an ordered structure with :ref:`cut`::

    (print (cut "abcdef" 1 4))  ; => bcd

Conditional logic can be built with :ref:`if`::

    (if (= 1 1)
      (print "Math works. The universe is safe.")
      (print "Math has failed. The universe is doomed."))

As in this example, ``if`` is called like ``(if CONDITION THEN ELSE)``. It
executes and returns the form ``THEN`` if ``CONDITION`` is true (according to
:class:`bool`) and ``ELSE`` otherwise. If ``ELSE`` is omitted, ``None`` is used
in its place.

What if you want to use more than form in place of the ``THEN`` or ``ELSE``
clauses, or in place of ``CONDITION``, for that matter? Use the special
operator :ref:`do` (known more traditionally in Lisp as ``progn``), which
combines several forms into one, returning the last::

   (if (do (print "Let's check.") (= 1 1))
     (do
       (print "Math works.")
       (print "The universe is safe."))
     (do
       (print "Math has failed.")
       (print "The universe is doomed.")))

For branching on more than one case, try :ref:`cond`::

   (setv somevar 33)
   (cond
    [(> somevar 50)
     (print "That variable is too big!")]
    [(< somevar 10)
     (print "That variable is too small!")]
    [True
     (print "That variable is jussssst right!")])

The macro ``(when CONDITION THEN-1 THEN-2 …)`` is shorthand for ``(if CONDITION
(do THEN-1 THEN-2 …))``. ``unless`` works the same as ``when``, but inverts the
condition with ``not``.

Hy's basic loops are :ref:`while` and :ref:`for`::

    (setv x 3)
    (while (> x 0)
      (print x)
      (setv x (- x 1)))  ; => 3 2 1

    (for [x [1 2 3]]
      (print x))         ; => 1 2 3

A more functional way to iterate is provided by the comprehension forms such as
:ref:`lfor`. Whereas ``for`` always returns ``None``, ``lfor`` returns a list
with one element per iteration. ::

    (print (lfor  x [1 2 3]  (* x 2)))  ; => [2, 4, 6]


Functions, classes, and modules
===============================

Define named functions with :ref:`defn`::

    (defn fib [n]
      (if (< n 2)
        n
        (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
    (print (fib 8))  ; => 21

Define anonymous functions with :ref:`fn`::

    (print (list (filter (fn [x] (% x 2)) (range 10))))
      ; => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Special symbols in the parameter list of ``defn`` or ``fn`` allow you to
indicate optional arguments, provide default values, and collect unlisted
arguments::

    (defn test [a b &optional c [d "x"] &rest e]
      [a b c d e])
    (print (test 1 2))            ; => [1, 2, None, 'x', ()]
    (print (test 1 2 3 4 5 6 7))  ; => [1, 2, 3, 4, (5, 6, 7)]

Set a function parameter by name with a ``:keyword``::

    (test 1 2 :d "y")             ; => [1, 2, None, 'y', ()]

Define classes with :ref:`defclass`::

    (defclass FooBar []
      (defn __init__ [self x]
        (setv self.x x))
      (defn get-x [self]
        self.x))

Here we create a new instance ``fb`` of ``FooBar`` and access its attributes by
various means::

    (setv fb (FooBar 15))
    (print fb.x)         ; => 15
    (print (. fb x))     ; => 15
    (print (.get-x fb))  ; => 15
    (print (fb.get-x))   ; => 15

Note that syntax like ``fb.x`` and ``fb.get-x`` only works when the object
being invoked (``fb``, in this case) is a simple variable name. To get an
attribute or call a method of an arbitrary form ``FORM``, you must use the
syntax ``(. FORM x)`` or ``(.get-x FORM)``.

Access an external module, whether written in Python or Hy, with
:ref:`import`::

    (import math)
    (print (math.sqrt 2))  ; => 1.4142135623730951

Python can import a Hy module like any other module so long as Hy itself has
been imported first, which, of course, must have already happened if you're
running a Hy program.

Macros
======

Macros are the basic metaprogramming tool of Lisp. A macro is a function that
is called at compile time (i.e., when a Hy program is being translated to
Python :mod:`ast` objects) and returns code, which becomes part of the final
program. Here's a simple example::

    (print "Executing")
    (defmacro m []
      (print "Now for a slow computation")
      (setv x (% (** 10 10 7) 3))
      (print "Done computing")
      x)
    (print "Value:" (m))
    (print "Done executing")

If you run this program twice in a row, you'll see this::

    $ hy example.hy
    Now for a slow computation
    Done computing
    Executing
    Value: 1
    Done executing
    $ hy example.hy
    Executing
    Value: 1
    Done executing

The slow computation is performed while compiling the program on its first
invocation. Only after the whole program is compiled does normal execution
begin from the top, printing "Executing". When the program is called a second
time, it is run from the previously compiled bytecode, which is equivalent to
simply::

    (print "Executing")
    (print "Value:" 1)
    (print "Done executing")

Our macro ``m`` has an especially simple return value, an integer, which at
compile-time is converted to an integer literal. In general, macros can return
arbitrary Hy forms to be executed as code. There are several special operators
and macros that make it easy to construct forms programmatically, such as
:ref:`quote` (``'``), :ref:`quasiquote` (`````), :ref:`unquote` (``~``), and
:ref:`defmacro!`. The previous chapter has :ref:`a simple example <do-while>`
of using ````` and ``~`` to define a new control construct ``do-while``.

Sometimes it's nice to be able to call a one-parameter macro without
parentheses. Tag macros allow this. The name of a tag macro is often just one
character long, but since Hy allows most Unicode characters in the name of a
macro (or ordinary variable), you won't run out of characters soon. ::

  => (deftag ↻ [code]
  ...  (setv op (last code) params (list (butlast code)))
  ...  `(~op ~@params))
  => #↻(1 2 3 +)
  6

What if you want to use a macro that's defined in a different module?
``import`` won't help, because it merely translates to a Python ``import``
statement that's executed at run-time, and macros are expanded at compile-time,
that is, during the translation from Hy to Python. Instead, use :ref:`require`,
which imports the module and makes macros available at compile-time.
``require`` uses the same syntax as ``import``. ::

   => (require tutorial.macros)
   => (tutorial.macros.rev (1 2 3 +))
   6

Next steps
==========

You now know enough to be dangerous with Hy. You may now smile villainously and
sneak off to your Hydeaway to do unspeakable things.

Refer to Python's documentation for the details of Python semantics, and the
rest of this manual for Hy-specific features. Like Hy itself, the manual is
incomplete, but :ref:`contributions <hacking>` are always welcome.
