Hack!
=====

Do this:

1. create a `virtual environment
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_::

       $ virtualenv venv

   and activate it::

       $ . venv/bin/activate

   or use `virtualenvwrapper <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#introduction>`_
   to create and manage your virtual environment::

       $ mkvirtualenv venv
       $ workon venv

2. get the source code::

       $ git clone https://github.com/hylang/hy.git

   or use your fork::

       $ git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/hy.git
3. install for hacking::

       $ cd hy/
       $ pip install -e .

4. install other develop-y requirements::

       $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

5. do awesome things; make someone shriek in delight/disgust at what
   you have wrought.
