Please come hack on hy!

Please come hang out with us on ``#hy`` on ``irc.freenode.net``!

Please talk about it on Twitter with the ``#hy`` hashtag!

Please blog about it!

Please don't spraypaint it on your neighbor's fence (without asking nicely)!


Hack!
=====

Do this:

1. create a `virtual environment
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_::

       $ virtualenv venv

   and activate it::

       $ . venv/bin/activate

   or use `virtualenvwrapper <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#introduction>`_
   to create and manage your virtual environment::

       $ mkvirtualenv hy
       $ workon hy

2. get the source code::

       $ git clone https://github.com/hylang/hy.git

   or use your fork::

       $ git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/hy.git
3. install for hacking::

       $ cd hy/
       $ pip install -e .

4. install other develop-y requirements::

       $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

5. do awesome things; make someone shriek in delight/disgust at what
   you have wrought.


Test!
=====

Tests are located in ``tests/``. We use `nose
<https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

To run the tests::

    $ nosetests

Write tests---tests are good!

Also, it is good to run the tests for all the platforms supported and for pep8 compliant code. 
You can do so by running tox::

    $ tox

Document!
=========

Documentation is located in ``docs/``. We use `Sphinx
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

To build the docs in HTML::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Write docs---docs are good! Even this doc!


Core Development Rules
======================

Pull requests are good!

Before you submit a PR, please run the tests and check your code against the style guide.  You can do both these things at once::

    $ make d

All incoming changes need to be acked by 2 different members of Hylang's
core team. Additional review is clearly welcome, but we need a minimum of
2 signoffs for any change.

If a core member is sending in a PR, please find 2 core members that don't
include the PR submitter. The idea here is that one can work with the PR
author, and a second acks the entire change set.

If the change is adding documentation, feel free to just merge after one
ACK. We've got low coverage, so it'd be great to keep that barrier low.


Core Team
=========

Core development team of hy consists of following developers.
