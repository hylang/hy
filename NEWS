 Thanks to theanalyst (Abhi) for getting the release notes
 together. You're the best!

  [ Breaking Changes ]
  
  We're calling this release 0.10 because we broke
  API. Sorry about that. We've removed kwapply in 
  favor of using `apply`. Please be sure to upgrade
  all code to work with `apply`.
  
  (apply function-call args kwargs)  ; is the signature

  [Thanks]

   Major shoutout to Clinton Dreisbach for implementing loop/recur.
   As always, massive hugs to olasd for the constant reviews and for
   implementing HyCons cells. Thanks to @kenanb for redesigning the
   new Hy logo.
    
   Many thanks to algernon for working on adderall, which helped
   push Hy further this cycle. Adderall is an implementation of miniKanren
   in Hy. If you're interested in using Adderall, check out hydiomatic,
   which prettfies Hy source using Adderall rules.
   
   This release saw an increase of about 11 contributors for a point
   release, you guys rock!

Changes from Hy 0.9.11

   tl;dr:

    0.9.12 comes with some massive changes,
    We finally took the time to implement gensym, as well as a few
    other bits that help macro writing. Check the changelog for
    what exactly was added. 
    
    The biggest feature, Reader Macros, landed later
    in the cycle, but were big enough to warrant a release on its
    own. A huge thanks goes to Foxboron for implementing them
    and a massive hug goes out to olasd for providing ongoing
    reviews during the development.
    
    Welcome to the new Hy contributors, Henrique Carvalho Alves,
    Kevin Zita and Kenan Bölükbaşı. Thanks for your work so far,
    folks!
    
    Hope y'all enjoy the finest that 2013 has to offer,
      - Hy Society

    * UTF-8 encoded hy symbols are now hy_... rather than __hy_..., it's

    =============== WARNING: WARNING: READ ME: READ ME: ===================
    From here on out, we will only support "future division" as part of hy.
    This is actually quite a pain for us, but it's going to be quite an
    amazing feature.

    This also normalizes behavior from Py 2 --> Py 3.

    Thank you so much, Konrad Hinsen.
    =======================================================================

      a need to create valid Python syntax without breaking the whitespace
      bits. (JD)

      be removed before 1.0. (GN)

    * `catch' now accepts a new format: (JD)

        (catch [e Exception] BODY)
        (catch [e [Exception1 Exception2]] BODY)
